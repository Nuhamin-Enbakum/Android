# Android-x86 OS Installation
This documentation outlines the installation process of Android-x86, an adaptation of the Android operating system designed to run on x86-based computers. It describes the necessary steps to set up the OS, including creating installation media, configuring system settings, and optimizing performance. Additionally, it covers the filesystems that Android-x86 supports and those that may present compatibility issues. Despite being originally developed for mobile devices, this version enables desktop users to experience Android in a structured computing environment. The document also explores virtualization, detailing its purpose, use cases, and how it allows Android-x86 to run on virtual platforms like VirtualBox or QEMU.

# System call implementation
This documentation provides an overview and implementation steps for the system call clock_settime(), using the C programming language. It defines the required header files, correct syntax, expected return values, and practical applications within the Android-x86 environment. The implementation demonstrates how to modify the system clock accurately, ensuring proper time management across processes. In Android-x86, system calls play a crucial role in interacting with the kernel, and clock_settime() is essential for synchronizing time-sensitive operations. The included C code showcases correct usage, exception handling, and system integration to ensure reliable execution.
